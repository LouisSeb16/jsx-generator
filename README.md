Tired of writing JSX code?
Well, this is a basic JSX generator that works from the command line. It saves you development time by helping you generate a jsx file and boilerplate code.
Simply run "npm run generate-jsx -- --name YourComponentName" and this generates accordingly.
NB: This generator creates files according to the file directory in this project. However, this can be edited to suit your file directory. 
NB: This is still in development, so expect a more robust structure and functionalities.
